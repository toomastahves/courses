# Alternative Front-End Setup Guide (without Docker)

This alternative method is useful if you encounter issues with Docker containers. Tested it with Node 20 and NPM 10 installed globally on a system:

1.	Navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd /courses/courses-frontend
```

2.	Install necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3.	Start local development server to serve application:
```
npm run serve
```

4.	Open web browser and visit application:
```
http://localhost:5000/
```
